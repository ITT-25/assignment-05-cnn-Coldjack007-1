# Sadly, due to personal reasons, I had no time to tackle the third exercise. The first two exercises are complete though!

## Hyperparameters
- My hyperparameter was "kernel size for the convolution layers"
- All info should be in the notebook.
- The relevant accuracy are found in the exercise's folder.

## Dataset
- My images are in the folder "images".
- Everything else is in the notebook.
